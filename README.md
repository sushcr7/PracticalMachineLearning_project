Course Project

The goal of the project

The description of the assignment contains the following information on the dataset:

    In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The goal is

    to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.
    
    
This repository contains the R code and the documentation of the final course project of the MOOC Practical Machine Learning on Coursera.

The task was to predict the type of barbell lift based on data from several accelerometers.


The corresponding R commands can be found in the RMarkdown file pml_project.Rmd.
